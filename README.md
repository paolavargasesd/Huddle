## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS preprocessor : SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive Layout

### What I learned

The purpose of buidling this project with scss wast to revised what I have learnt about sass sometimes ago and I realised that the knowledge is still there to an extent. but there were some properties I nearly forgot how to use them. I provided some examples of some sass functions and keyword below

```scss
@mixin & @include, @include custom-name {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

This in-built sass properties @mixin basically allows to create chunks of code and use it multiple times using the @include keyword accross our file. It's something that is supper benefial to use.
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

There are lots of functions and properties in sass that will enhannce your development much faster if you know them, that is why i still have to focus more on how to implement all the great features of sass like the `scss @function keyword , @for, @each, @debug and so on`

### Useful resources

This is was a simple project that did not require any resources for me to do except the one provided by Frontend Mentor. They were the necessary resources needed to accomplish this project
